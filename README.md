# randomhn
Playing with the HN API.

In this project I'm retrieving 10 random stories from https://hacker-news.firebaseio.com/v0/topstories.json and displaying them in the order of their score (ascending). I've also included the karma score of the user that submitted the story and a few links to get more out of this than a basic list.
